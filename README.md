## Install
Just got to extensions (`Shift+Cmd+X`), and type `console.log` in the search bar. Install the extension and click `Reload`.

## Displaying your snippets as first suggestions
As you can see in the example on the top, the snippets appear as the first suggestions on autocomplete for me.
This can come very handy, and it is very easy to set up:

1. Open Settings (`Cmd + ,` on Mac)
2. Add the following line to your personal settings: `"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top"`
